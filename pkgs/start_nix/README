start_nix is the counterpart to boot/json: it reads /boot/nix.json and displays a userspace boot menu.

cmds to set up a typical boot environment:
  ne -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/boot -i -f ./pkgs/start_nix
  # Set up rescue shell environment. By keeping it separately from the system env, it has a chance to stay functional if we mess the latter one up.
  ne -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/boot -i zsh coreutils
