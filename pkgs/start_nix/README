start_nix is the counterpart to boot/json: it reads /boot/nix.json and displays a userspace boot menu.

cmds to set up a typical boot environment:
   ne -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/boot -i -f ./pkgs/start_nix
   # Set up rescue shell environment. By keeping it separately from the system env, it has a chance to stay functional if we mess the latter one up.
   ne -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/boot -i zsh coreutils


Note that nixos-install will result in a starting environment where neither the system nor rescue shells work; to get the former to work, run
   cd <dir>
   # Python3 doesn't like to run without it.
   mknod --mode 600 dev/urandom c 1 9
   mknod --mode 666 dev/null c 1 3
   chroot . /$(echo nix/store/*-nixos-[0-9]*/activate)
Then, to use it for initial chrooting:
   chroot . /$(echo nix/store/*-python3-3.4.4/bin/python3) /etc/nixos_site/pkgs/start_nix/start_nix.py
After that, install a boot profile as above.
